# MicrocontrollerCPUBenchmark
A simple benchmark designed to test the raw CPU power of microcontrollers. The test was designed to run on Arduinos, but can be run on a huge range of microcontrollers due to it's tiny memory footprint (4.25kB of programming space and 354B of RAM. Could be reduced further by removing the output strings.)
